# Uniary Operators
# Binary Operators
# Ternary Operators

# 1. Uniary Operators: Unary Operator is an operator that operates on a single operand,
# like a unary minus.
# Unary minus (-x)
# Increment (++)
# Decrement (â€“)
# Logical NOT (!x)

print(age)

# Addition (+)
# Subtraction (-)
# Multiplication (*)
# Division (/)
# Assignment (=)
# Logical AND (&&)
# Logical OR (||)

# 3. Ternary Operator: Ternary Operator is an operator that evaluates an expression
# he ternary operator is a conditional operator that takes three operands: a condition, a value to be returned if the condition is true, and a value to be returned if the condition is false. It evaluates the condition and returns one of the two specified values based on whether the condition is true or false
